  description: 'This is a general permission to be able to access ALL guzzlenodes/external APIs (but not use them - you will need to specify usernames/roles inside EACH guzzlenode). Note 1: this ENABLES/DISABLES everything for everyone.So, you MUST have this permission in order to do anything. Note 2: From "RESTful Web Services" you can further control access to Drupal GET,POST,PATCH REST points. The final check is done when you check if the current USERNAME is declared in the specific guzzlenode'
